Data Query Language (DQL) is a sub-language of Structured Query Language (SQL).  

#### SELECT statement

The `SELECT` statement is the one (and only) statement needed to construct database queries.  A query extracts data from the database.  A `SELECT` statement **must** contain a `FROM` clause.  The basic syntax for `SELECT` statement is:

```SQL
SELECT column(s) FROM table(s)
```

Often (although not necessary) each statement/clause is written at the beginning of a line.  In particular, 

```SQL
SELECT column(s) 
FROM table(s)
```

NOTE: If database is housed on a shared server, the database name must proceed the table name separated with the dot notation.  In particular, 

```SQL
SELECT column(s) 
FROM database.table
```

If multiple columns are desired in the query results, a comma delimited list of column names is supplied after the `SELECT` statement. Similar a list of one or more tables follows the FROM clause.   The query below SELECTs `column1`, `column2`, and `column3`. 


```SQL
SELECT column1, column2, column3 FROM database.table;
```



The * is a wildcard and returns **all** columns from the table.  

For example, the following query will return the entire table (use with caution).

```SQL
SELECT * FROM database.table;
```


#### The WHERE clause

The `WHERE` clause is a conditional that limits the number of records returned to ones that match a specified *condition*.  The value of the condition is TRUE or FALSE.  The `WHERE` clause limits or **filters** the number of records returned by the query. The general syntax is:

```SQL
SELECT column(s)
FROM database.table
WHERE [condition]
```
For example, selecting all records from the products table where country is China, 

```SQL
SELECT *
FROM Products
WHERE country='China';
```


Multiple/complex conditions can be specified using `AND` or `OR`.  In particular,

```SQL
SELECT column(s)
FROM database.table
WHERE [condition1] AND/OR [condition2]
```


#### The ORDER BY clause

Another clause that can be added to a `SELECT` statment is the `ORDER BY` clause.  Like the name implies, it will order the records in ascending or descending order.  Ascending is default.  It can be used with or without the `WHERE` clause.  

```SQL
SELECT column1, column2
FROM database.table
ORDER BY column2;
```

#### The DISTINCT option

The `DISTINCT` option is used in a query to select distinct records.  The syntax is, 

```SQL
SELECT DISTINCT column
FROM database.table;
```



#### The COUNT function

The `COUNT` function is used, as the name implies, to count the results of the query.    

```SQL
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM database.table;
```

#### Exercises

**Directions**: Create a GitHub account.  All assignments will be submitted to your GitHub account.  You can use any format (e.g., .md, .txt) EXCEPT word processors (e.g., MS Word) to upload your solutions.  All queries will use the `Products` table.  Connect to the database.  Copy [Products.sql](https://github.com/jamesquinlan/mat301/tree/master/products), change database name to your database, paste in Query window, then execute.

1.What does SQL stand for?  How is it pronounced?

***`Structured Query Language, S.Q.L or sequel`***

2.Are SQL commands case-sensitive?  How can you determine?

***`SQL commands are case-insensitive in Windows, this can be determined by running the program.`***

3.What does DQL stand for?

***`Data Query Language`***

4.True or False:  Is it necessary to use the `FROM` clause with the select statement? 

***`True`***

5.True or False:  Is it necessary to use a `WHERE` clause?  If not, when and why would you use a `WHERE` clause?

***`It is not necessary to use a WHERE clause in a DML statement. WHERE clauses are used to limit the number of records returned by the query by filtering records to match a specified condition`***

6.What is the purpose of the `ORDER BY` clause?  What is its default value?  

***`The ORDER BY clause orders records in ascending or descending order. The default value is ascending.`***

7.Is the data in the products table case sensitive?  Should it be case sensitive/insensitive? 

***` `***
